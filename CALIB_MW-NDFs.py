"""
By:  Siddhartha Saggar\n
Aim: Measure transmittance of NDF filter combinations in the Motorized Wheelset for set incident wavelength.\n
==================\n
Suggestions:\n
1. This script depends on libraries: LightBlock.py, TLPM.py, and Wheels.py.\n
2. Wheel_Calibration.txt provides required rotation values for WS corresponding to different filter pairs.\n
3. Install XiLab software package from Standa (WS) with its drivers to control motorized wheelset controller.\n
4. Install Thorlabs optical powermeter related software with its drivers to control its display console.\n
5. The last filter combination listed in Wheel_Calibration.txt is used as the reference (assumed 100% transmittance) \n 
   Ensure this is intentional â€” typically, this should be the 'no filter' configuration\n
6. OPM has its own filter to provide reliable results, for illumination in 10 micrwatt domain or higher. \n
